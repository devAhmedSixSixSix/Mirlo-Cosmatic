## About The Project
The main challenge is to build out this full page website with react and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. Filter the products base on price and category. 
3. Save the items in wishlist. 
4- See the products you add to the cart.
5. I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## Built with
 * React
 * React Router
 * React Bootstrap
 * React Icon's
 * Swiper.js
 
## What I learned
A great project to practice on React, React Router, React Bootstrap, React icon's, Swiper.js.
